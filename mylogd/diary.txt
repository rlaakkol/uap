This assignment taught me a lot about IPC via named pipes and a bit about
threads.

The part concerning threads was actually surprisingly painless and nice! This
may have been because this particular use did not require complex race
condtions or even joining. The only required synchronization manoeuvre was
setting up one mutex and locking it before writing to a file and unlocking
afterwards.

This didn't stop me from scratching my head a bit after valgrind announced
that pthread_create() is leaking memory. I had succesfully missed the fact
that if the thread is not joined, it has to be detached for the resources to
be freed. This was luckily again very simple, and now my overall view of
threads is very positive! Maye this will change if I have to pass more complex
arguments to threads at some point...

The pipe and IPC part was a whole different story, though.
