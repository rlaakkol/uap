This is my second attempt at this course, and I picked the same assignment for
the first phase. Last time I never got to a phase where I would have been able
to catch any signals, but now I was more successful.

As the main subject of the task is signaling, I will first contemplate the
"smart" usage of signals. Tasks such as this one, file transfer, does not fall
into this category. An average POSIX programmer is most likely happiest, if he
only needs to care about cleaning up (or other correct behaviour) after SIGCHLD,
SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL or SIGHUP.

Most current applications that have to deal with asynchronous events (such as
signals) tend to use the libevent API, and for IPC, socket based APIs are a bit
more convenient than handling signals manually. However, it is always nice to
know the basis of things so that it is possible to know the limitations and
drawbacks of these higher level solutions.
